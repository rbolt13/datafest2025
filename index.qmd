## About Me

Iâ€™m the Data Equity and Innovation Supervisor for [Paid Leave Oregon](https://paidleave.oregon.gov/), where I lead a team of data analysts in transforming complex data into insights with Tableau and R.

Outside of work, I explore data through various personal projects that incorporate analytics, visualization, and storytelling. Check out my blogs, dashboards, and talks to see more.
