## About Me

Iâ€™m the Data Equity and Innovation Supervisor for [Paid Leave Oregon](https://paidleave.oregon.gov/), where I lead a team of data analysts in transforming complex data into insights with Tableau and R.

Outside of work, I explore data through various personal projects that incorporate analytics, visualization, and storytelling. Check out my blogs, dashboards, and talks to see more.

## Agenda

* R & Taylor Swift Data (5 min)  

* Text Mining & `tidytext` (10 min)  

* Topic Modeling (15 min)  

* Review & Q&A (8 min)  

* Closing 

## Introduction to R

## Getting Started with R

R is a statistical programming language that's incredibly powerful for working with data. Unlike Python which is built around _objects_, R is based on _functions_. For our purposes, that means we'll be calling functions (like F(x)=Y) to transform our data rather than attaching properties to objects. 

## Packages

Most of the work we'll do relies on packages, which are basically toolkits. To use one, you will first need to install it with a base R function `install.packages()`: 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
install.packages("package_name")
```

After installing a package, you can load it into your current session with `library()`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
library("package_name")
```
